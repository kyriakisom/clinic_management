# clinic_management
The topic of the current project is the design and implementation of a web application for the management of a medical practice. In particular, the application allows the management of patients' information, their history and their appointments with the doctor. The application is usable by patients, the secretaries of the practice and the doctor.


#how_to_run_it
In the vscode terminal, type "npm install", to download the folder "node_modules" (The node_modules folder can become very large because it includes all dependencies required for the project, even those required by other dependencies, that's why you have to install it.) and then type "npm start", to start the server.
